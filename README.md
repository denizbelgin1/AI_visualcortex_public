# AI_visualcortex_public
Modelling of vertebrate brain through primarily modelling of visual cortex. Accomplishing and implementation of sensing, experiencing, recognizing, pattern recognition, recalling, imagining, dreaming, thinking creatively and inspiringly, guessing, selecting, sequencing and ordering logically, chronologically, relationally and geographically, deciding, responding by the mammalian brain model and its known components and elements. The physiological neurological human brain functions (and further beyond) is the relevance domain.

Project starts with the first "embroyonic stem cell" i.e. the uralt neuron of the visual cortex. (growing visual cortex in a petri dish)  
Modelling & functioning & examples & testing & PoC will be realized through recognition of hand written glyphs (digits, letters, drawings) 
This is not a Machine Learning ML or Deep Learning project.
