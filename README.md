# AI_visualcortex_public
Modelling of vertebrate brain through primarily modelling of visual cortex. 
Accomplishing sensing, recogizing, experiencing, living, learning, storing, recalling, imagining, decision making, aswering, dreaming, creative thinking, pattern recognition, resembling, artistic impressioning implementation by modelling the mammal brain and its known components and elements. The physiological neurological human brain functions ( and furtherbeyond )  is the relevance domain. 

Project starts with the first "embroyonic stem cell" i.e. the uralt neuron of the visual cortex. (resembling growing of the visual cortex in a petri-dish)  
Modelling & functioning & examples & testing & PoC will be realized through recognition of hand written glyphs (digits, letters, drawings) 
This is not a Machine Learning ML or Deep Learning project.
