The Hodgkinâ€“Huxley model, or conductance-based model, is the inspirational scientific basis for this project:

The action potentials' initiation and propagation will be attempted to be modelled with a particular focus on the higher-level meaning producing processes in a broader scope rather than the molecular events and the electrochemical circuitry within the neural cell. 
There will be no oscillations considered before returning to the resting action potential.

The form, duration and amplitude of the spike both in the membrane and propogated, the conduction velocity, the impedance changes during the spike, the refractory period and subthreshold responses are not considered and beyond the scope.

Thermodynamics issues with electrochemical processes in a semi-closed environment are also beyond the scope. 

However the amplitude of the spike and its propagation realm and reach remains within the scope.

Modelling of primate brain through primarily modelling of visual cortex. Accomplishing and implementation of sensing, experiencing, recognizing, pattern recognition, recalling, imagining, dreaming, thinking creatively and inspiringly, guessing, selecting, sequencing and ordering logically, chronologically, relationally and geographically, deciding, responding by the mammalian brain model and its known components and elements. The physiological neurological human brain functions (and further beyond) is the relevance domain.




Project starts with the first "embryonic stem cell" i.e. the uralt neuron of the visual cortex. (growing visual cortex in a petri dish)  
Modelling & functioning & examples & testing & proof of concept (PoC) will be realized through recognition of hand written glyphs (digits, letters, drawings) 
This is not a Machine Learning (ML) or Deep Learning project.
