Modelling of vertebrate brain functioning through recognition of hand written glyphs ( digits, letters, drawings ) 
No ML or deep learning algos.
Sensing, recogizing, experiencing, living, learning, storing, recalling, imagining, decision making, aswering, dreaming, creative thinking, pattern recognition, resembling, artistic impressioning implementation by modelling the mammal brain and its known components and elements. Whatever the physiological neurological brain of ours is capable of ( and even further ) is within the realm of this project. 
The start is the first embroyonic stem cell i.e. the uralt neuron of the visual cortex.
